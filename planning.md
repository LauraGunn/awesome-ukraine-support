To do's for effcetive outreach and coordination betwen https://bit.ly/ua-table, https://scienceforukraine.eu/, and https://www.embo.org/solidarity-with-ukraine/

## Topics and minutes for Mar 9, 2022

Our goal is to develop a single landing page that would direct UA scientists to labs willing to support them as well as any other additional information. This page will point to https://bit.ly/ua-table and https://scienceforukraine.eu/ (which will continue operate as they are) as well as any other resource (we need to actively search and pursue other efforts to participate in this initiative).

### Accessibility

Eliminate the confusion. We need to provide clear and concise information for two types of audiences: (1) UA scientists and students [our target group] and (2) PIs of the labs who want to help. 

 - How to use this site (e.g., if you are an undergraduate look through the tables and identify labs specifically mentioning undergraduate support)
 - How to add new lab listings to this site
 - The above info needs to be in EN and UA and needs to bed "mobile"-ready as many people who we target probably only have mobile phones and possible bad internet)

### Technical issues

 - We (@nekrut and @bgruening) think that the best mechanism to run such as page is through GutHub (e.g., like this one). This makes collaborative contributions much easier. Anyone can add information to this page via pull request mechanism. 
 - We need to create a series of mailing lists: (1) containing e-mails of all labs that sighed up and (2) internal list for this group. Perhaps a better option is a series of slack or matrix rooms.

### Supporting materials

- A set of standard responses in EN and UA for responding to requests. These need to be stratified by carrer levels
- A set of promotional texts in EN and UA that we use when asking people to retweet, redistribute, etc...

### Going forward 

- We should think of turning this into a general framework for helping all scientists affected by wars and other crises
- Extending to non academics? We (Anton, Bjoern) had some questions to extend this to industry partners as well.
